Appendix:
This Project is created using JavaScript library 'React.Js' and Raw CSS. To fetch data from API used axios and for icons used react-icons. Data is fetch from JSONPlaceholder.


Features:
  
  
  
  .Pagination
  .Add New User
  .Edit Existing User
  .Delete User

  
Challenges Faced during development:
  
  
  
  Sharing data as props from one component to multiple other components.
  Managing and keeping note of every prop shared.
  While editing every data's edit botton was change so to overcome that problem I created new component.


Improvements I would make if given more time:


To manage props I would have used Redux Toolkit, which would have overcome the prop-drilling problem.
Would have made UI more attractive by using CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Material UI.
